# Stock Market Prediction System - Usage Guide

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Simple Analysis (Recommended for immediate use)
```bash
python3 simple_stock_analyzer.py
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Analyze both training and test data
- ‚úÖ Generate trading signals
- ‚úÖ Provide comprehensive reports
- ‚úÖ Work with standard Python (no additional packages needed)

### Option 2: Advanced Analysis (Requires additional packages)
```bash
# Install required packages (if possible)
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

# Run advanced analysis
python3 stock_predictor.py
```

### Option 3: MATLAB Implementation
```matlab
% In MATLAB command window
run_stock_prediction
```

## Understanding the Output

### Data Validation Report
- **Total records**: Number of data points analyzed
- **Data quality score**: 0-100 (higher is better)
- **Issues found**: Any data quality problems

### Price Statistics
- **Price range**: Minimum to maximum prices
- **Average/Median price**: Central tendency measures
- **Standard deviation**: Price volatility measure

### Technical Indicators
- **Volatility**: Measure of price fluctuation
- **SMA 10/50**: Simple Moving Averages
- **Trend direction**: Bullish (SMA 10 > SMA 50) or Bearish (SMA 10 < SMA 50)

### Trading Signals
- **Buy signals**: Recommendations to buy (üü¢)
- **Sell signals**: Recommendations to sell (üî¥)
- **Hold signals**: Recommendations to hold current position
- **Signal frequency**: Percentage of active signals (should be reasonable, not too high)

## Trading Signal Interpretation

### Signal Types
1. **BUY Signal**: 
   - Moving average crossover (SMA 10 > SMA 50)
   - Strong upward momentum (>5% price increase)

2. **SELL Signal**:
   - Moving average crossover (SMA 10 < SMA 50)
   - Strong downward momentum (>5% price decrease)

3. **HOLD Signal**:
   - No clear trend or momentum
   - Default recommendation

### Risk Assessment
- **High volatility**: Use smaller position sizes
- **High signal frequency**: Consider filtering signals
- **Poor data quality**: Clean data before trading

## File Structure

## Data Format

The CSV files should contain columns:
- **Date**: Trading date
- **Open**: Opening price
- **High**: Highest price of the day
- **Low**: Lowest price of the day
- **Close**: Closing price

## Performance Metrics

### Accuracy Measures
- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error (lower is better)
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error (lower is better)
- **MAPE**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (lower is better)
- **R¬≤**: Coefficient of determination (closer to 1 is better)

### Trading Performance
- **Directional Accuracy**: Percentage of correct direction predictions
- **Signal Frequency**: How often signals are generated
- **Risk Level**: Assessment based on volatility and accuracy

## Recommendations

### For Beginners
1. Start with the simple analyzer
2. Focus on understanding the signals
3. Practice with paper trading first
4. Never risk more than you can afford to lose

### For Advanced Users
1. Use the Python implementation for better accuracy
2. Implement additional technical indicators
3. Add risk management rules
4. Consider ensemble methods

### For Production Use
1. Implement proper backtesting
2. Add real-time data feeds
3. Create automated trading systems
4. Implement portfolio management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File not found**: Ensure CSV files are in the same directory
2. **Import errors**: Use the simple analyzer if packages are missing
3. **Poor predictions**: Check data quality and consider more features
4. **Too many signals**: Adjust signal generation thresholds

### Getting Help
1. Check the implementation review document
2. Validate your data format
3. Start with simple analysis before advanced features
4. Test with historical data before live trading
